# FriendFinder

Node and Express powered survey to match the best friend for the user.


### Overview

An application where the user answers 10 questions and the app compares their responses with 10 preexisting profiles saved in an object. The app displays the name and picture of the profile with the best match in a modal popup.
Each question gives the user the option to select 1 through 5 of how much they agree or disagree with the statement. 
The answers are then compared to those already given to find the closest match.
